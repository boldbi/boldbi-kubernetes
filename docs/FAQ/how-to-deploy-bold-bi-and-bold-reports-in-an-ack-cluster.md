# Deploying Bold BI and Bold Reports in Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes (ACK) Cluster
This section provides instructions on how to deploy Bold BI and Bold Reports in an Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes (ACK) cluster. Please follow the documentation below to successfully deploy these applications.

# Deployment Methods

There are two ways to deploy Bold BI and Bold Reports on the Kubernetes cluster. Please refer to the following documents for Bold BI and Bold Reports deployment:

* [Deploy Bold BI and Bold Reports using Kubectl](#deploy-bold-bi-and-bold-reports-using-kubectl)
* [Deploy Bold BI and Bold Reports using Helm](#deploy-bold-bi-and-bold-reports-using-helm)

Please click on the respective links to access the detailed documentation for each deployment method.

# Deploy Bold BI and Bold Reports using Kubectl

The following steps will guide you through the process of deploying Bold BI and Bold Reports using Kubectl in an Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes (ACK) cluster.

## Deployment prerequisites

The following requirements are necessary to deploy the Bold BI and Bold Reports solution using Kubectl:

* [Install Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl): Make sure you install kubectl on your local machine to facilitate the deployment process.
* [NAS File System](../pre-requisites.md#ack-file-sotrage): Set up a NAS file system to store the required data for Bold BI and Bold Reports.
* [Create and connect a ACK cluster](../pre-requisites.md#ack-cluster): Create and connect an ACK cluster in Alibaba Cloud that will host the Bold BI and Bold Reports deployment.
* Load Balancing- [Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) : By default, an Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes (ACK) cluster has Nginx already installed in the kube-system namespace, so there is no need to install it manually. The Nginx Ingress Controller is available and can be utilized to enable load balancing for your Bold BI and Bold Reports deployment.

Please ensure that you have fulfilled these prerequisites before proceeding with the deployment.

## Steps for Bold BI and Bold Reports auto deployment using kubectl.

1. Download the deployment file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boldbi/boldbi-kubernetes/main/deploy/deploy/common_ack_deploy.yaml) to deploy Bold BI and Bold Reports on AKS.

2. Navigate to the folder where the deployment files were downloaded in **Step 1**.

3. Follow the documentation provided at [this link](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/nas/latest/create-a-nas-file-system) to create a `file system` in Alibaba Cloud.

4. Once the file system is created, locate and click on the cube icon. This will allow you to view the mount target hostname. Take note of the mount target hostname, as you will need it for mounting the file system with our application.

   ![NAS-Mount-Target](images/Nas-mount-target.png)

5. Open the **common_ack_deploy.yaml** file and replace the `<host_name_of_mount_target>` placeholder with the actual mount target hostname noted in the previous step.

    ![PV Claim](images/ack_pv_claim.png)

6. If you have a DNS to map with the application, proceed to the next steps, otherwise, skip to **Step 10**. 

7. In the common_ack_deploy.yaml file and locate line 2335. Uncomment the host value and replace example.com with your DNS hostname.

      ![DNS](images/ack_ingress_http_yaml.png)
  
8. If you have an SSL certificate for your DNS and need to configure the site, follow next step; otherwise, skip to **Step 10**.

9. In the ingress spec of the common_ack_deploy.yaml file, uncomment the tls section. Replace example.com with your DNS hostname and save the file.

      ![ingress DNS](images/ack_ingress_tls_yaml.png)

10. After connecting with your cluster, run the following command to retrieve the External IP address:

      ```sh
      kubectl get svc -n kube-system
      ```
      Repeat the above command until you find the IP address listed in the EXTERNAL-IP column, as shown in the following image:

      ![Ingress Address](images/ack_ingress_address.png)

11. Note the EXTERNAL-IP address and map it to your DNS if you have added it in the common_ack_deploy.yaml file. If you do not have a DNS, use the EXTERNAL-IP address to access the application.

12. Replace `<application_base_url>` with your DNS or EXTERNAL-IP address.

    Examples: `http://example.com`, `https://example.com`, `http://<external_ip_address>`
    
    ![App_Base_Url](images/ack_app_base_url.png) 
    
13. Read the optional client library license agreement from the following link.

    [Consent to deploy client libraries](../docs/consent-to-deploy-client-libraries.md)
    
14. By default, all client libraries for Bold BI and Bold Reports will be installed in Kubernetes. However, you can overwrite them by specifying the required libraries as a comma-separated list in the environment variable noted from the above link.

    ![Optinal_Lib](images/ack_optional_lib.png) 

15. Deploy Bold BI and Bold Reports in your Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f common_ack_deploy.yaml
    ```

16. Create a TLS secret with your SSL certificate using the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl create secret tls bold-tls -n bold-services --key <key-path> --cert <certificate-path>
    ```

17. Check the status of the pods by running the following command:

     ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n bold-services
     ```
    ![Pod status](images/ack_pod_status.png) 

18. Wait until you see the applications in the running state. Then, use your DNS or EXTERNAL-IP address obtained from the following command to access the application in the browser.

    ```sh
    kubectl get ingress -n bold-services
     ``` 

19. For more details on configuring the application startup, please refer to the [this](#application-startup).


# Deploy Bold BI and Bold Reports using Helm

The following steps will guide you through the process of deploying Bold BI and Bold Reports using Helm in an Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes (ACK) cluster.

## Deployment prerequisites

* [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/): Make sure you have Helm installed on your local machine to facilitate the deployment process.
* [NAS File System](../pre-requisites.md#ack-file-sotrage): Set up a NAS file system to store the required data for Bold BI and Bold Reports.
* [Create and connect a ACK cluster](../pre-requisites.md#ack-cluster): Create and connect an ACK cluster in Alibaba Cloud that will host the Bold BI and Bold Reports deployment.
* Load Balancing- [Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) : By default, an Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes (ACK) cluster has Nginx already installed in the kube-system namespace, so there is no need to manually install it. The Nginx Ingress Controller is available and can be utilized to enable load balancing for your Bold BI and Bold Reports deployment.

**Note:** Obtain the **Nginx External IP** address by running `kubectl get svc -n kube-system` and map it with a DNS in order to craft the values.yaml file when installing Bold BI and Bold Reports using the Helm chart.

## Get Repo Info

1. Add the Bold BI and Bold Reports helm repository.

```console
helm repo add boldbi https://boldbi.github.io/boldbi-kubernetes
helm repo update
```

2. View charts in repo.

```console
helm search repo boldbi

NAME            CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
boldbi/bold-common   7.8.18           7.8.18         Embed powerful analytics inside your apps and t...
```

_See [helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for command documentation._

## Create Namespace

Run the following command to create the namespace where the Bold BI and Bold Reports resources will be deployed in the Kubernetes cluster. The default namespace is <i>bold-services</i>.

```console
kubectl create ns bold-services
```

## Install Chart

For the Helm chart, you need to craft a `values.yaml` file. So download the values.yaml file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boldbi/boldbi-kubernetes/main/helm/custom-values/common-ack-values.yaml) and make required changes based on your cluster provider.

The following table allows you to craft the `values.yaml` file with required values for Bold BI and Bold Reports deployment. So please read the description carefully and enter the values in values.yaml file.
